## ✅ All Fixes Applied:

### 1️⃣ **Fixed Undefined Referral Code**

**Problem:** User's referral code was showing as "undefined" in the Referrals page and share message.

**Root Cause:** The referral-related fields weren't being returned in the login/authentication response.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `backend/controllers/authController.js` - login function
- ✅ Added referral fields to login response:
  ```javascript
  referralCode: user.referralCode,
  referralBonus: user.referralBonus,
  referralBonusApproved: user.referralBonusApproved,
  hasInvested: user.hasInvested,
  referrals: user.referrals
  ```

**Result:** User's referral code now loads correctly from the context/auth state.

### 2️⃣ **Fixed Copy Code Functionality**

**Problem:** Copy button wasn't working properly, showing undefined code.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `frontend/src/pages/Referrals.js`
- ✅ Added loading state check
- ✅ Added error handling for referral code
- ✅ Improved copy function with Promise handling:
  ```javascript
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(user.referralCode).then(() => {
    setCopied(true);
    setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), 2000);
  }).catch(err => {
    alert('Failed to copy code. Please copy manually.');
  });
  ```
- ✅ Added fallback UI if referral code doesn't load

**Result:** 
- Copy button now works reliably
- Shows "Copied!" feedback for 2 seconds
- Error handling if clipboard API fails
- Loading spinner while fetching data
- Error message with refresh button if code fails to load

---

### 3️⃣ **Disabled Register Button Until T&C Accepted**

**Problem:** Users could register without accepting Terms & Conditions.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `frontend/src/pages/Register.js`
- ✅ Modified register button:
  ```javascript
  disabled={loading || !termsAccepted}
  ```
- ✅ Dynamic button text:
  ```javascript
  {loading ? 'Creating Account...' : 
   termsAccepted ? 'Register' : 
   'Accept Terms to Continue'}
  ```
- ✅ Added link to T&C page:
  ```jsx
  <Link to="/terms" target="_blank">Terms & Conditions</Link>
  ```

**Result:** 
- Register button is grayed out and disabled until checkbox is checked
- Button text changes to guide user
- T&C link opens in new tab
- Cannot submit form without accepting terms
